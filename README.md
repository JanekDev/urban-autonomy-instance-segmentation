# Urban Autonomy Instance Segmentation

## Introduction

"Urban Autonomy Instance Segmentation" is a project focused on comparing deep learning instance segmentation models in an urban environments autonomous driving technology setups. Utilizing the COCO dataset, this project applies instance segmentation methods to identify and segment various objects encountered in urban driving scenarios, such as vehicles, pedestrians, and street signs.
